# Samples

The contained projects are all for reference and experimentation.

It is not recommended to use the contained code as-is for production code.  It can often be simplified per use case.

## Subfolders


 * Architecture - Ways of structuring code to build a project.
 * Algorithms - Number crunching
 * Data Structures - Data storage
 * Web - Contains projects that only make sense when talking about websites.


## "Common" folder

In the contains projects it is common to see a "Common" folder.
I use a "Common" folder to store modules that can be copy-pasted to other projects then used with minimal extra coding.
