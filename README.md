# Samples

The contained projects are all for reference and experimentation.

It is not recommended to use the contained code as-is for production code.  It can often be simplified per use case.

If anything herein needs to evolve to something stable, I'll pull it out into its own repo.  Again, this repo is just for reference and experimentation.


## "Common" folder

In the contains projects it is common to see a "Common" folder.
I use a "Common" folder to store modules that can be copy-pasted to other projects then used with minimal extra coding.
